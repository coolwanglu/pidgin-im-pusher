pidgin-im-pusher (previously gtk-ftischhauser-notifo) is a plugin of Pidgin, with which you may let pidgin push all received messages to your iOS devices when you are away from your computer.


You can specify the statuses at which pidgin should push the messages, and two push services are supported, notifo and pushme.to.

pidgin-im-pusher avoids missing messages when you are outside with your iPhone (iTouch, iPad). Multiple protocols are supported naturally through pidgin.

However it is not an alternative of services like eBuddy and IM+, as you cannot reply the messages directly. But this plugin should be useful for those do not want to give their passwords to third parties.

Check the wiki pages for the usage.
