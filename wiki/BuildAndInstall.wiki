#how to build and install

==If you have the source files of Pidigin==
  * download and throw the file 'impusher.c' into the directory 'pidgin/plugins' in the pidgin source tree
  * run 'Make impusher.so'
  * copy impusher.so to '~/.purple/plugins'

==Otherwise==
  * make sure pidgin and headers files are installed, the latter one are usually named 'pidgin-dev' in Linux distributions
  * checkout the source code 
  * ./configure && make && make install 
  * *root/sudo is NOT required when installation*
