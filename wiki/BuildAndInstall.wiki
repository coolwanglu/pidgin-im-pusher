#how to build and install

==If you have the source files of Pidgin==
  * download and throw the file [http://pidgin-im-pusher.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/impusher.c 'impusher.c'] into the directory 'pidgin/plugins' in the pidgin source tree
  * run 'make impusher.so'
  * copy impusher.so to '~/.purple/plugins'

==Otherwise==
  * make sure pidgin and header files are installed, the latter one is usually named 'pidgin-dev' in Linux distributions
  * checkout the source code 
  * run './configure && make && make install'
  * *root/sudo is NOT required when installation*
